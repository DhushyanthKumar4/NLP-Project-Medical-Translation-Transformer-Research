Objective
Building and rigorously evaluate a domain-specific medical translation model (EN↔KO) and analyze:
•	Domain robustness
•	Data efficiency
•	Hallucination & faithfulness behavior
•	Cross-domain generalization

Input → Output
Input (X):
•	English or Korean medical sentence
Output (y):
•	Corresponding translation
Task Type:
•	Sequence-to-sequence generation

Primary Metrics
•	BLEU
•	COMET (if possible)
•	Terminology consistency rate
•	Hallucination frequency
•	Length ratio deviation
Secondary:
•	Per-domain performance breakdown
•	Performance vs dataset size curve

Constraints
Constraint-	Reason
Faithfulness- critical	Medical domain
Avoid hallucinatio-n	Safety implications
Reproducibility-	Research signal
Scalability-	

Success Criteria
•	Competitive BLEU on held-out test set
•	Low hallucination rate
•	Graceful degradation in low-resource regime
•	Clear experimental insights
